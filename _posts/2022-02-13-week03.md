As we entered our third week of classes, we began to talk about technologies we will be utilizing this semester. We began discussing Version Control Systems and their purpose and also had an introduction to Git. Later in the week, we were given the opportunity to speak with [Jim Hall](https://hallmentum.com/about/jimhall/), the founder and project coordinator of the [FreeDOS](https://www.freedos.org/) Project. As a long time professional in the field, Hall gave us an insightful and informatiive presentation about FreeDOS and open source projects and also answered many of mine and my classmates' questions.
