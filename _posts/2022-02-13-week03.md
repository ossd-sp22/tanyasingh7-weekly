As we entered our third week of classes, we began talking about technologies we'll be utilizing throughout the semester. We began discussing Version Control Systems and also had an introduction to Git. Later in the week, we were given the opportunity to speak with [Jim Hall](https://hallmentum.com/about/jimhall/), the founder and project coordinator of the [FreeDOS](https://www.freedos.org/) Project. As a long time professional in the field, Hall gave us an insightful presentation about FreeDOS and answered many of our questions about Open Source.
