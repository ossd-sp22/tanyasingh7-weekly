title: "Week 5: Evaluating Open Source Projects"

This past week we focused on evaluating open source projects and were split into groups of two and three to each specifically focus on one, specific open source project. My group was assigned to evaluate Font Awesome, an open-source icon library and toolkit that I am quite familiar with. It was really interesting to look at the library and evaluate it in terms of it being an open source project. It was really eye opening to see what makes or breaks an open source project, in regards to actually contributing and actively participating within a project. I quickly realized that Font Awesome was not an open source project I’d want to contribute to in the future.

## Font Awesome 

Funny enough, [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) was the open source project that I listed as my favorite project at the start of our class. In the past, I have used Font Awesome many times before. Within my digital media and web programming classes, I’ve used many of the different icons available throughout their library. Not only does it have icons, but it also has animations and a WordPress plug-in available. I remember constantly seeing a section on their website that said, [“Font Awesome is one of the top open source projects on GitHub”](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome).

I remember thinking that it was really cool how I could look at the code used to program the library and remember looking through the javascript files when I was first getting into web development. However at the time, still very unfamiliar with GitHub, I thought open source solely meant that the code was available to view online. I had no idea that individuals could contribute to the project itself and also use the code and manipulate it on my own in any which way I want. So, entering the class, I was really interested in possibly contributing to Font Awesome. However, although the functionality and availability of the project are great, I recently realized that the open source project itself does not follow suit. I was shocked. 

The whole repository and project itself was overall very confusing. It was hard to navigate how contributions went about because the contributions file made it seem like users could only submit issues and the two main contributors would quickly work to eradicate the problem. The GitHub repository showed that there were 2 contributors and 215,000 users. I was confused at first because I wasn’t quite sure what a ‘user’ meant and amounted to. All of the commits in the repo had only been done by the two contributors, Rob Madole and Geremia Taglialatela. I was a bit confused on how the project worked as an open source project, if no one was able to make commits to the code. Additionally, only allowing users to submit issues doesn’t seem to be very collaborative and open to me. 

However, to my surprise, it was cool to see that the project did in fact follow some of the components of an open source project. It had a README file full of relevant information, a license file with three different licenses, and even a Code of Conduct which had been adapted from the Contributor Covenant. I realized that going forward, repositories are going to hold a lot more meaning to me because I‘ll actually be able to understand the random different files I used to ignore. Before this class, I would have never thought twice to look at a LICENSE.txt, CONTRIBUTING.md, or CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md. 

However, while the project did contain these files, I realized that it wasn’t a project I would be able to make meaningful contributions to. There was no form of communication within the group, unless it was between you and one of the two main contributors, and while submitting a PR is allowed, the project didn’t seem like a good fit for a beginner in open source. After doing this activity, I was able to see what I did and did not want from the open source project I choose to actively contribute to. I want there to be an easy and seamless form of communication between the contributors, and I want the project itself to be vocal and open to contributions for beginners. Such as projects that tag specific issues as good for beginners. While I was disappointed to see that I wouldn’t be able to make contributions to Font Awesome, I was relieved that I was able to come to this understanding before it was too late. Overall, the activity was very informative and will definitely be helpful going forward. 

## Open Source & Diabetes 

On another note, on Thursday, while class was canceled we were given a handful of short films to watch. The ones that stood out the most to me were the ones centered around Diabetes and making Continuous Glucose Monitoring technology accessible to all by being an open source project. This really stood out to me because this past summer, I was working in health care for a health insurance company and my intern class was focused on working with CGMs and other health devices. We created API’s to gather the data from the devices and worked on a prototype version of an online portal that both providers (doctors) and patients could access to see 24/7 monitoring of their health devices. Our main focus was on CGM’s and diabetes, but we also incorporated health devices such fitbits, heart rate monitors, smart weights, and pulse oximeters so we could track all different types of health statistics. However, our focus was specifically on CGM devices and gathering and organizing the statistics from it. The health insurance company I was working for is called HealthFirst and it's a health insurance company based in New York. They are a non-profit and their aim is to help lower income neighborhoods in New York and provide them with low cost health insurance. So while working with these CGM devices, we also had to keep in mind how we could ensure that this technology would be accessible to all. Because while many other companies have worked on similar softwares, they tend to forget about individuals who may not have access to a smartphone. We also got to work on creating Alexa-based voice controls to connect to CGM devices to monitor glucose levels. It was so interesting to see how another company, with similar intentions, went about creating similar technology. The incorporation of making the tech open-source allows for the software to be even more accessible. It was crazy to see how my summer experience connected immediately to what we’re talking about in one of my classes this semester. I remember when I first started watching the short films I was so taken back by how familiar it all was to me. Over the summer, we had never even talked about the possibility of making it open-source, which is understandable as they were creating these portals for their patients and providers in mind. However, we talked about the need and necessity for accessible monitoring for all diabetics and TidePool is making it one step closer for them.
