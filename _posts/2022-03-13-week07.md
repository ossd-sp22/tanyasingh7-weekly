This past week we reviewed and discussed the text, "The Cathedral and the Bazaar". As a class, we discussed the lessons and the main points of the reading. There were many key points that stood out to me and many that I was able to understand and relate to. In addition to the reading, we began to start thinking about the types of projects we want to contribute to for the remainder of the semester. To prepare and begin brainstorming, we completed an activity called *Taking Stock* in which we were able to organize our aspirations, resources, and potential for contributing to open source projects. The activity was very helpful and writing out my goals, resources, and interests allowed for me to realize the type of contributions I can and want to make in the coming future.

## The Cathedral and The Bazaar

The text, "The Cathedral and The Bazaar" discusses and distingushes the contrasting differences between two development styles using a very relevant example, the development of Linux. These two development approaches are in the sense of a **cathedral** and a **baaazar**.
