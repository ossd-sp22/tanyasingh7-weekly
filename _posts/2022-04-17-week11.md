#### By: Tanya Singh
###### April 17, 2022 
This week we continued our discussion on why businesses use and support open source projects. On Tuesday, we began watching some videos from [Open Source in Business](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwBgcnITw43mboBSplHDRMQ). These videos are all discussions centered around different aspects of *open source in business*, of course. There were four indicated videos to watch and they were all very intriguing, but one of them, [The Transformation of an Industry: Open Source in Film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDfD3uvsjtA) stood out to me the most. Film has always been a side interest of mine and it was really great to see how open source is able to integrate with and ultimately improve different industries. A huge future dream and goal of mine is to work in tech within the digital media / film industry, so it is really motivating and encouraging to see the application of the integration of the two that corresponds with my current class work and prior knowledge. During class on Thursday, we all grouped up and continued working on our contributions to our chosen projects.  My group mates and I were busy fixing some issues that arose in our first PR and were also able to claim another issue to work on.

### Why do businesses use and support open source?

During class on Tuesday, we began watching four videos from the [Open Source in Business](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwBgcnITw43mboBSplHDRMQ) channel: [Lessons Learned from Open Source in Business](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnbDwrGZFuw), [The Transformation of an Industry: Open Source in Film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDfD3uvsjtA), [Why should you have an Open Source Program Office?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYjVwzd7Xrs), and [How InnerSource can accelerate culture change](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4DY2WB66RU). 

[Lessons Learned from Open Source in Business](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnbDwrGZFuw) was a very fascinating discussion hosted by Dave Neary. The video features hightlight clips of many different guests and speakers from the Open Source Summit that occured in Seattle on September 27th, 2021. Some of the videos clipped within this video are segments from the other videos as well. The variety of guests touch upon points and themes of user-driven communities, core business questions for open source businesses, the value of community to open source companies, the relationship between open source values and successful businesses, and open source supply chain management. [The Transformation of an Industry: Open Source in Film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDfD3uvsjtA) was also hosted by Dave Neary and features guests, Carol Payne from Netflix and Larry Gritz from Sony. The discusson surrounds the basis of technoloogy used within the film industry. Before, many companies used to develop and create their own tools, however overtime the industry began to collaborate and work on tools that can be useful for all. This new technology not only increases efficiency for all, but it also allows the industry itself to greatly improve and advance. Carol and Larry talk about how this change from non-collaborative to collaboative went about, discussing the technical and cultural changes that hed the media industry to begin embracing open source software. Additonally, the two discuss the role that open source plays today in media production, and the technological challenges the industry expects to facee in the future. [Why should you have an Open Source Program Office?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYjVwzd7Xrs) talks about the role of open source program offices outside the software industry. This discussion is hosted by Dave Neary and features speakers, Nithya Ruff, Executive Director of the Open Source Program Office of Comcast and chair of the board of the Linux Foundation, and Gil Yehuda, Head of Open Source Engineering and Technology at U.S. Bank. The two discuss the role that OSPO's (Open Source Program Offices) have played in evolving the attitude towards conforming to an open source model, to the risks of consuming open source software, and allowing engineers to begin developing and contributing to open source projects. The two discuss the reasons behind why more and more companies have begun starting OSPO's of their own and discussed the visible difference between working in an industry where technology is an enabler of customer value, rather than the primary driver of revenue. Lastly, [How InnerSource can accelerate culture change](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4DY2WB66RU) is hosted by Leslie Hawthorn and features Danese Cooper from NearForm and Isabel Drost-Fromm from Europace. They discuss the benefits of InnerSource as a way to accelerate culture change, and to encourage adoption of open tools, standards, and best practices in software development in large organizations. 

The video, however, that stood out to me the most was [The Transformation of an Industry: Open Source in Film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDfD3uvsjtA). Growing up, I have been exposed to many different elements of the film industry. When I was young, my dad pursued one of his dreams and went to film school in NYC. Both of my parents had graduated from college with computer science degrees, but my dad had always had a passion for movies and film. Unfortunately, after graduating, my dad had realized that raising and financially supporting a family while working in this field was not practical. So, he left the film industry and went back to working a normal 9-5. However, during this time he began working at Avid Technology and was able to build a video editing software in which he received both an Emmy award and patent for the development. Growing up, I was always fascinated by my dads achievements and quckly realized that I wanted to work in the entertainment industry. As I came into college, I found an unexpected passion for computer science and quickly reshaped my future goals to incorporate CS. My passion in film is more from a behind the scenes perspective. I have always enjoyed the editing, color grading, special effects, and animations. The tools that are used to complete these tasks are very integral in the process of filmmaking. While watching this video, I was able to comprehend the extent of what open source can do for the industry. These tools are so integral for the industry as a whole, and with this new advancement, I truly feel like the industry will be able to make great strides and advancements. The industry itself is very expensive and so many tools are so expensive. It makes accessibility very difficult to those who are new to the industry. By making these tools open source and available to all, they are ultimately making the industry more accessible and opening up so many new doors. Many people hold a passion for film and filmmaking but are stopped due to the financial burden it requires. With these technologies growing and spreading, I believe that the indusry will continue advancing and transforming. 

### Group Progress

On Thursday, my group and I continued working on submitting our first PR. After we had submitted our first PR, we received some comments from one of the moderators asking us to modify a few things. We needed to modify our commits and PR description and code as one of the checks failed. During our weekly meeting on Wednesday, we began working on these changes and were able to resolve why one of the checks failed. We ran into some trouble mergeing and rewording our commit messages, so we decided to call it a night and work on it the next day in class. In class, we modified the PR description and inserted the additional screenshot they requested. We were able to reword the commits and we let the moderator know that we had made the changes she had requested. While we waited to hear back from her, we began searching for an issue to claim. After looking through the various options, we claimed a [new issue](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/21800). We knew that this issue would be more difficult than our last one, but we were familiar with what we would need to do in order to create a phone number validater and country code drop box. However, as we began to work on the issue, we ran into difficulty finding where in the code we needed to add this code. Prior to starting the project, Joana had warned us that students in the past ran into difficulty working with the code as they didn't necessarily document it. At first this didn't seem like an issue, but now we are starting to understand our past peers' frustrations. While working on our new issue, we were hoping for our first PR to be merged, however we were informed that we still needed to make some modifications to our commit history. While we found a simple tutorial to do this online, we keep facing different merge conflicts and errors as we try to make these modifications. While we hoped that our first PR would be merged by now, we are still actively working on resolviing these errors and working towards additional contributions as well.
