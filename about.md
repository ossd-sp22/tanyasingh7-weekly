## About 

Hello! My name is Tanya Singh and I'm from Boston, Massachusetts. I am a senior at NYU studying Computer Science and Digital Art. 



### More Information
I'm very interested in app development and plan on working as an app developer in NYC after graduation. I'm also really into digital media and animation and hope to be able to incorporate them with cs in the future. I'm excited to learn more about open source and am very excited to get to know everyone better throughout the semester! I also like coffee. Feel free to message me on slack or email me at ts3516@nyu.edu :)
