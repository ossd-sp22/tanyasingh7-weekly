Hi! My name is Tanya Singh and I'm from Boston, Massachusetts. I am a senior at NYU studying Computer Science and Digital Art. 


### More Information

I'm very interested in app development and plan on working as an app developer in nyc after graduation. I'm excited 
to learn more about open source and am very excited to get to know everyone better throughout the semester! I like music and coffee :)
